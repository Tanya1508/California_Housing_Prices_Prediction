# California_Housing_Prices_Prediction
This dataset is used in the second chapter of Aurélien Géron's recent book 'Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow'. 
I have taken this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices
The data pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data.
We have to predict the median house value based on the different features given.
We will implement three regression models for this dataset, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor to see which of them performs the best.
We will also do some Data Processing, Feature Engineering, and Hyperparameter Tuning to make our model more robust and make more accurate predictions.
